%this file explains the meaning of columns for the competition data files: cybersecurity_training.csv and cybersecurity_test.csv
alert_ids				-	an identifier of the alert, values from this column should be used to match the corresponding records from the event_logs files 
client_code				-	encrypted identifiers of clients for which alerts were generated
notified				-	a binary column indicating whether a client was notified about the alert (the target column in this task); this column is missing in the test data!
categoryname			-	a category name of the alert that corresponds to its severity
ip						-	an encrypted IP address corresponding to the alert; the first two octets were encrypted for public addresses, and for addresses from private networks, the second and third one; each octet was encrypted independently (the same code on different octets corresponds to different values) but values of the same octet are consistent, e.g. addresses AB.CD.1.1 and AB.CD.1.10 come from the same sub-network
ipcategory_name			-	a category of the corresponding IP, created based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses
